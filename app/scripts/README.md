Scripts
========================

This is all client-side JavaScript for use within the Angular app. 

There are two key custom files: 

- app.js   
  the logic for the app. There are a couple new directives in this file 

- controllers.js  
  the controllers for the page and for the custom directives


There are also some other supporting JS files here. 


- editInPlace.js   
  the logic for the edit-in-place directive 

- log.js  
  a simple class for doing in-browser (visible) logging. 

- dateFormat.js    
  utility class for formatting date objects for display

- bootstrap.js   
  the standard bootstrap.js file

- ui-bootstrap-tpls-0.4.0-SNAPSHOT.js   
  a patched modified version of ui-bootstrap v0.4.0, with the templates. 
  I can't remember what I needed to patch here. I did this before v0.4.0
  was released, but I haven't upgraded to the official 0.4.0.  This is a bug.
