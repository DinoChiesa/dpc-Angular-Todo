Toy Todo List App
========================

This toy todo list app uses [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/)
for MVC, [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) for
styling, and [Usergrid](https://apigee.com/usergrid) for backend
storage. The scaffolding was created with yeoman, which is
nice.** Yeoman also gave me [Grunt](http://gruntj.com) for
running a test server with automagic
[LiveReload](http://livereload.com/) capability.

All good.


I've published it as a simple example.
