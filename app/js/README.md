Scripts
========================

This is all client-side JavaScript for use within the Angular app. 

There are two key custom files: 

- app.js   
  the logic for the app. There are a couple new directives in this file: 
  editInPlace is an attribute. textareaPopover is an element.
  Also, there is a dateFormatter filter. 

- controllers.js  
  the controllers for the page and for the custom directives


There are also some other supporting JS files here. 

- log.js  
  a simple class for doing in-browser (visible) logging. 

- dateFormat.js    
  utility class for formatting date objects for display

- ui-bootstrap-tpls-0.5.0-patched.js   
  a patched modified version of ui-bootstrap v0.5.0, with the templates. 
  This one adds a horizontal collapse.
